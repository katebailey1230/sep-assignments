1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
  It would take 7 iterations using linear search.
2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
  It would take 3 iterations using binary search.
3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
  fib(10) = 55
  fib(11) = 89
  fib(12) = 144
4. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  Since there's no order or logic to the million items, it would make sense to use a linear search with an iterative solution since there's no pattern.
5. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  Because it's sorted, I would use a binary search with a recursive solution since I would need to call the binary function on itself a number of times to pinpoint the item in question.
