2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.
A. A database would be used when you have a large amount of data that you'd need to be able to access
  quickly and easily, or if you needed to run multiple applications that can handle accessing the data.
  A text file might be used when you have basic, small amounts of data.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
A. While you'd have to write an algorithm with other programming languages to find data you're looking
  for, with SQL you only have to declare what data you want from a database, and that database will
  determine the quickest and most efficient way to spit out the data.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
A. A database is an application used to manage data that can be accessed on an interface. The data
  is not readable directly from the database, but is formatted to be read quickly and efficiently
  by the database.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
A. A table holds a set of rows and columns that intersect so that each cell contains a value. The columns
    are used to separate data type, and the rows are used to separate individual datum.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.
A. Integer, DateTime, and String.
