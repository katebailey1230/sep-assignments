1. Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
	-Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
	hotel=# SELECT guest.name, booking.check_in_date FROM guest LEFT OUTER JOIN booking ON (guest.name = booking.guest) WHERE booking.guest IS null;
      name      | check_in_date

	-Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
	-Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
	-Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
	
2. Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.
	I'm thinking 3 tables: students, classes, and grades.
	Students (ID integer, name text)
	Classes (ID integer, name text)
	Grades (Class ID integer, Student ID integer, Grade CHAR(1))
