1. Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
	-Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
	hotel=# SELECT guest.name, booking.check_in_date FROM guest LEFT OUTER JOIN booking ON (guest.name = booking.guest) WHERE booking.guest IS null;
      name      | check_in_date 
----------------+---------------
 Sally Jennings | 
(1 row)

	-Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
	
	SELECT  count(b.check_in_date), b.guest FROM booking b GROUP BY b.guest HAVING count(b.check_in_date) = 2;
 count |   guest    
-------+------------

(1 row)

	
	-Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
	SELECT g.name, b.room, count( b.check_in_date) FROM booking b  LEFT OUTER JOIN guest g ON (g.name = b.guest) GROUP BY b.room, g.name HAVING count(DISTINCT check_in_date) > 1;
    name     | room | count 
-------------+------+-------
 Al Einstein |  600 |     2
(1 row)

	-Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
	SELECT count(DISTINCT b.guest), b.room FROM booking b GROUP BY b.room; 
 count | room 
-------+------
     2 |  300
     1 |  350
     1 |  400
     3 |  600
(4 rows)
	
2. Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.

	-Find all students who have taken a particular class.
	
	school=# SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.class_name 
	FROM student s 
	JOIN grades g 
	ON (s.student_id = g.student_id) 
	JOIN classes c 
	ON (g.class_id = c.class_id) 
	ORDER BY c.class_name;
	
 first_name | last_name |  class_name

 Claire     | Delaney   | organic_chem
 Jules      | Winnfield | organic_chem
 Steve      | Buscemi   | spanish1
(10 rows)

	
	
	-Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
	
	SELECT c.class_name, g.grade, count(g.grade) 
	FROM grades g 
	JOIN classes c 
	ON (g.class_id = c.class_id) 
	GROUP BY g.grade, c.class_name 
	HAVING c.class_name = 'organic_chem';
	
  class_name  | grade | count 
--------------+-------+-------
 organic_chem | D     |     2
 organic_chem | C     |     1
(2 rows)

	
	-Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
	
	SELECT c.class_name, count(g.class_id) 
	FROM grades g 
	JOIN classes c ON (g.class_id = c.class_id) 
	GROUP BY c.class_name;
	
  class_name  | count

	-Find the class taken by the largest number of students.
	
	school=# SELECT c.class_name, count(g.class_id) FROM grades g JOIN classes c ON (g.class_id = c.class_id) GROUP BY c.class_name ORDER BY count(g.class_id) DESC LIMIT 1;
