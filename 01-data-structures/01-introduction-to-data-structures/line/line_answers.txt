1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

It makes most sense for the data structure of the line to be an array, since each element or "person" in the array is automatically labeled by index. It's easy to find the element you're looking for either by searching for the value or the index.
